## Invention Title

**German:**  
MyMolt — Souveräne Multi-Persona-KI-Agentenplattform mit generationaler Identitätshierarchie und eIDAS-kompatibler Richtlinienerzwingung

**English:**  
MyMolt — Sovereign Multi-Persona AI Agent Platform with Generational Identity Hierarchy and eIDAS-Compatible Policy Enforcement

---

## Core Claims Summary

The patent application covers the following inventive contributions:

1. **Sovereign AI Agent Runtime** — A local-first AI agent runtime with a persistent, locally-stored identity file (Soul), a role-based multi-persona system, a locally-encrypted vault component, and a trust-level-driven policy enforcement layer — without mandatory cloud dependency.

2. **Generational Household Model** — A single agent runtime serving multiple family members with automatic, persona-specific content protection profiles: CSAM and grooming detection for child personas; financial exploitation and manipulation pattern detection for senior personas; monitoring rights for administrator personas.

3. **eIDAS as First-Class Identity Source** — eIDAS 2.0-compatible identity providers (state-issued digital identities) as first-class authentication sources in AI agent policy enforcement, including selective attribute disclosure for age verification without revealing exact age.

4. **Sub-2µs Policy Gate** — A policy enforcement layer achieving < 2µs full gate latency per agent interaction (measured: 1.345µs, Apple M-Series ARM, Release build, 100,000 iterations), enabling > 700,000 gated interactions per second per CPU core.

5. **Corporate Template Deployment** — A template-based deployment model allowing parallel instances sharing a corporate policy and individual Soul identity files, with sub-contractor hierarchies and HSM-compatible compliance audit chains.
